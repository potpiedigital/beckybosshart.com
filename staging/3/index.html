The fantasy novel I started as a high-schooler is in a box in my father’s shed, along with two large bins of journals. Using my experience as a journalist and university writing instructor, and all that practice I did at a young age, I have taken a lot of joy in guiding young students in writing. I’ve taught creative writing to middle schoolers (a summer camp at UNLV) and high schoolers at Ovidius University and with Fulbright Romania. I have learned something important since when I was a teenager trying to write my first book: a novel needs time to stew. <em>Go back to it, work a bit more, add and cut and play with sentences. Wait a while, and put it through another draft.</em> As an undergraduate student at the University of Nevada, Reno, I was in a hurry. I wanted to be published daily to a broad audience and see immediate results in the community. After graduating with my journalism degree, I worked as a community news reporter in several under-served areas, and in the state’s small-town capital. I covered the housing crash for the Nevada Appeal in Carson City, earning the Nevada Press Association award’s for Best Business Coverage. I reported on the Fallon leukemia cluster for the daily Lahontan Valley News, winning several awards for feature writing and photography. My investigative stories lost the newspaper several large advertisers; I was still supported by the editors. But after five years as a journalist, I wanted to slow down and see more of the world than just the Great Basin. I taught English for a year at a hagwon in Seoul, South Korea. I circled the globe, finally able to afford to visit all the historic parts of Asia and Europe that I had dreamed of seeing. Since then I’ve taught college writing in Ukraine and Romania, improving English curriculum for studying contemporary American literature and essay writing.</p> </div> <img src=./images/bb-photo2.png> <div class=info> <h4>ROMANIA 2009 - 2012</h4> <p>The Land of Beech Trees is a remote region artificially separated by the Soviet Union in 1940 between Ukraine and Romania, and it has been a pivotal environment for me as a writer. I started writing the twelve short stories and novella included in my Hotel Bukovyna collection in 2012 as a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer in Ukraine. I returned to Bucovina, the southern half in Romania, as a Fulbright grantee in 2015, where I continued to work on The Beech Tree Land Chronicles, the novel that has also grown out of my ideas and experiences in Ukraine and Romania. I'm interested in the themes of crossing cultures, culture and language wars, rootlessness, and place.<span><a class=more-photos href=#>MORE PHOTOS</a></span></p> </div> <img src=./images/bb-photo3.png> <div class=info> <h4>UKRAINE 2009 - 2012</h4> <p>My master’s thesis, Hotel Bukovyna, has its own dramatic tale. After all the Peace Corps Ukraine volunteers were evacuated following the 2014 Euromaidan Revolution, I lived off the kindness of friends and family for nearly seven months while I prepared for my MFA thesis defense, half a year earlier than I had planned. At the same time, I also taught a college class on contemporary Ukrainian literature in translation, and founded a project that raised $1,000 to buy new books for my Ukrainian university. I found Ukraine to be oddly similar to Las Vegas, my home city, in many ways. Both have a startling wealth gap, a history of corruption and mafia influence (still dominant in Ukraine). Las Vegans and Ukrainians both love the “fabulous”— present in our entertainment, architecture, and personal style. There’s also a ubiquitous military culture, something you can never avoid in a former Soviet-Bloc country.<span><a class=more-photos href=#>MORE PHOTOS</a></span></p> </div> <img src=./images/bb-photo4.png> <div class=info> <h4>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA<br>2009 - 2012</h4> <p>Becky Bosshart is a 2015-2016 Fulbright grantee to Romania and a graduate of the Master's International Creative Writing Program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas after serving with the Peace Corps in Ukraine from 2012 to 2014.
